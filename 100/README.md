# 100 - Introduction

This add-on runs Visual Studio Code, allowing you to edit your Home Assistant configuration straight from the web browser and can be embedded straight into the Home Assistant frontend UI.

Visual Studio Code runs as a remote server using code-server, and is a fully fledged VSCode experience.

The add-on has the Home Assistant, MDI icons and YAML extensions pre-installed and pre-configured right out of the box. This means that auto-completion works instantly, without the need for configuring anything.
